# A list of test name prefixes to skip (usually because they are marked as "standalone-compatible", but make assumptions
# that are only valid for C++ standalone).
# Test names have to use pytest's syntax, i.e. "test_name.py::test_function". Note that these are *prefixes*, so all
# tests with names starting with the given prefix will be skipped.
