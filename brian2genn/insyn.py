'''
GeNN accumulates postsynaptic changes into a variable inSyn. The idea of this
module is to check, for a given Synapses, whether or not it can be recast into
this formulation, and if so to relabel the variables appropriately.

In GeNN, each synapses object has an associated variable inSyn. The idea is
that we will do something like this in Brian terms:

    v += w (synapses code)
    dv/dt = -v/tau (neuron code)

should be replaced by:

    inSyn += w (synapses code)
    dv/dt = -v/tau (neuron code)
    v += inSyn; inSyn = 0; (custom operation carried out after integration step)
    
The reason behind this organisation in GeNN is that the communication of spike events and the 
corresponding updates of post-synaptic variables are separated out for better performance. In 
priniciple all kinds of operations on the pre- and post-synaptic variables can be allowed
but with a heavy hit in the computational speed.

The conditions for this rewrite to be possible are as follows for presynaptic
event code:
- Each expression is allowed to modify synaptic variables.
- An expression can modify a neuron variable only in the following ways:
     neuron_var += expr (where expr contains only synaptic variables)
     neuron_var = expr (where expr-neuron_var can be simplified to contain only synaptic variables)
- The set of modified neuron variables can only have one element
And for the postsynaptic code, only synaptic variables can be modified.

The output of this code should be:
- Raise an error if it is not possible, explaining why
- Replace the line neuron_var (+)= expr with addtoinSyn = new_expr
- Return neuron_var so that it can be used appropriately in GeNNDevice.build

The GeNN syntax is:

    addtoinSyn = expr


Brian codegen implementation:

I think the correct place to start is given a Statement sequence for a 
Synapses pre or post code object, check the conditions. Then, we need to create
two additional CodeObjects which overwrite translate_one_statement_sequence to
call this function and rewrite the appropriate statement.
